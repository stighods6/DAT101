      <li>[. Why is object-oriented development so important in programming?
        2. In Task 1, we create a static object called "AccountType." Explain what this object is used for and
        how this type of object can help us in software development.
        3. Discuss why we use encapsulation in classes. Why do we want to "hide" code within our class?
        Explain how we can create "private" and "public" members in a constructor function.
        4. Explain what happens when we use the "new" command in JavaScript]</li>

        1. 
        It organizes code into objects for better readability, reusability, and maintainability. It supports modularity, encapsulation, inheritance, and abstraction, making complex systems easier to manage.
        
        2. 
        It stores fixed values like account types (SAVINGS, CHECKING). It centralizes data, avoids hardcoding, reduces errors, and makes the code cleaner and easier to maintain.
        
        3.
        Encapsulation protects data and simplifies usage by hiding implementation details.
        
        Private: Use #fieldName (e.g., #balance).
        Public: Use this.fieldName (e.g., this.type).
        It ensures data integrity and controlled access.
        
        4. 
        new creates an object, links it to a prototype, runs the constructor to initialize it, and returns the object.]</p>
